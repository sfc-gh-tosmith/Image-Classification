In this Hands-on-Lab, you will create an image classification service that runs in Snowpark Container Services. You will also create a file processing pipeline using streams, tasks, and a UDF. This lab brings together content from the following sources:
- [SPCS Tutorial - Level 1](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/tutorials/tutorial-1)
- [Creating a file processing pipeline in Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-dirtables-pipeline)
- [Image Classification using Tensorflow and Flask](https://geekpython.in/flask-app-for-image-recognition#google_vignette)

#### This Hands-on-Lab has two parts. 
- Part 1: local development/testing of the container. 
- Part 2: creating the SPCS service and image processing pipeline through the Snowsight UI.

## Part 1:
First, create a conda environment by typing this in your terminal
```
  conda create -n "image-classification-spcs" python=3.9
```
Activate by entering 
```
  conda activate image-classification-spcs
```
Install the necessary dependencies by typing
```
  conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```
Test the flask app by running
```
  python3 app.py
```
Go to [localhost:5000/healthcheck](localhost:5000/healthcheck) and it should say "I'm ready"

##### Optional:
Using an API request tool like Postman, build a POST request to [localhost:5000/prediction](localhost:5000/prediction) by copying the example_request.json file contents into the body of the request. The response should look something like this:
```json
{
    "data": [
        [
            0,
            "3"
        ]
    ]
}
```

## Part 2:
For part 2, follow the **setup.sql** file. In this file you will:
- Create a database, schema, and stages
- Create a compute pool to run your service on
- Build and push the docker container from your local machine into Snowflake
- Create the image classification service, running in Snowpark Container Services
- Create a function to interact with the running service
- Build the stream, UDF, and task for the file processing pipeline
